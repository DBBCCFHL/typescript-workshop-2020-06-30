# Typescript Workshop

## Workshop structure â›©

Each section will include a lesson, exercise, and solution.

`lesson.md` will contain the plan and notes for each section.

`lesson/` will act as out scratch pad during the lesson.

Within `exercise/` you'll find an `exercise.md` which outlines what you'll need to do.

`solution/` contains my solution to the questions in `exercise.md`

## How it works

Process for every lesson:

1. Lesson & Q&A
   - Example code from lesson will be pushed to repo so you can reference it during the exercises
2. Exercise
   - ~ 20 - 30 minutes per exercise
3. Solution
