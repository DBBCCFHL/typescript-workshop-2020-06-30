# Typescript Workshop

This workshop has been designed to empower you with the foundations of Typescript. I want you to feel comfortable starting your next React project using TS.

Consider it a tool you can reference as you continue to build and expand your knowledge of TS.

## Workshop structure ‚õ©

Each section will include a lesson, exercise, and solution.

`lesson.md` will contain the plan and notes for each section.

`lesson/` will act as out scratch pad during the lesson.

Within `exercise/` you'll find an `exercise.md` which outlines what you'll need to do.

`solution/` contains my solution to the questions in `exercise.md`

## How it works

Process for every lesson:

1. Lesson & Q&A
   - Example code from lesson will be pushed to repo so you can reference it during the exercises
2. Exercise
   - ~ 20 minutes per exercise
   - I recommend reading through all of the questions in an exercise before coding
   - Go slow and read the errors. Typescript will usually guide you in the right direction.
3. Solution
